# Python_ML_Practice

These are my self-learning ML practice projects using Python(sklearn) following the instruction of "Machine Learning Mastery With Python BY Jason Brownlee".
Besides basics of ML knowledge, there are three ML projects using some well-known dataset.

* [Classification] Iris Dataset
* [Regression] Boston Housing Price Dataset
* [Binary Classification] Sonar, Mines and Rocks Dataset
