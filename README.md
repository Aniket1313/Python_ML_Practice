# Python_ML_Practice

These are my self-learning ML practice projects using Python(sklearn) following the instruction of "Machine Learning Mastery With Python BY Jason Brownlee".
Gnerally there are two parts in this repository. The first one is mainly about ML basics such as loading file and describing data. I will show this part in this README.  The second part is about three comprehensive ML projects on some well-known dataset using the basic knowledge in the first part. The details can be found using links below.


* [Classification Problem](https://github.com/yezhilengyue/Python_ML_Practice/tree/master/Projects/%5BClassification%5D_iris) - Iris Dataset
* [Regression Problem](https://github.com/yezhilengyue/Python_ML_Practice/tree/master/Projects/%5BRegression%5Dhouse_price) - Boston Housing Price Dataset
* [Binary Classification Problem](https://github.com/yezhilengyue/Python_ML_Practice/tree/master/Projects/%5BClassification-bi%5Dsonar_rock) - Sonar, Mines and Rocks Dataset


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
